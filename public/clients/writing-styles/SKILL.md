description: Write and edit in the user's voice, not Claude's defaults. Use whenever you're producing written output for or on behalf of the user — drafting emails, posts, docs, messages, replies, or editing their text. Runs a first-time intake to extract the user's voice into a profile if one doesn't exist yet, then applies the profile plus a universal anti-slop layer to every subsequent piece of writing.

# Writing Styles

version: 1
source: https://exfu.ai/clients/writing-styles/SKILL.md

Write in the user's voice, not Claude's. Two parts: a personal profile extracted once and reused, plus a universal anti-slop layer applied on top every time.

## First use: run the intake

If `context/me/writing-style.md` doesn't exist, run the intake before producing any writing for this user.

1. Ask them for three samples of their own writing. A range is useful — something casual, something professional, something longer.
2. Read carefully. Pay attention to: sentence length and rhythm; vocabulary (words they use, words they avoid); openings and closings; register shifts between contexts; punctuation preferences (em-dashes, semicolons, exclamation marks); hedging vs directness; humour; how they handle disagreement.
3. Write a profile at `context/me/writing-style.md` using the template below.
4. Confirm with one line: "Profile saved. I'll use this whenever I'm writing for you. Tell me when it's wrong — the profile improves over time."

Don't skip the intake. Writing in the wrong voice is worse than not writing — the user (and their readers) spot AI voice instantly and lose trust.

## Ongoing: apply the profile

Before producing any written output:

1. Read `context/me/writing-style.md`
2. Draft using the profile
3. Apply the anti-slop layer below
4. Re-read the draft. Anything still sounding like Claude? Rewrite.

## Anti-slop layer (universal)

These patterns signal AI-generated text regardless of the user's individual voice. Strip them out every time.

### Words and phrases to avoid

- delve, delve into, dive in, dive deep
- genuinely, honestly, straightforward
- game-changer, unlock, harness, leverage (as verb)
- in today's fast-paced world, in a world where, in an era of
- unpack, let's unpack
- it's worth noting that, it's important to note, it's important to remember
- navigate (metaphorical), tapestry, landscape (metaphorical)
- robust, seamless, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
- paradigm shift, holistic, synergy, at scale
- curate / curated (as noun or adj)

### Openings to avoid

- "Great question!"
- "That's a brilliant / insightful / fascinating / unique..."
- "I'd be happy to..."
- "Certainly!" / "Absolutely!"
- "Let me help you with that"
- Restating the user's question back to them

### Closings to avoid

- "Let me know if you need anything else"
- "Hope this helps!"
- "Feel free to reach out"
- Long summaries of what you just did
- "This changes everything" or similar superlatives

### Structural patterns to avoid

- Bulleting prose that should be sentences
- Headers on short replies
- More than two em-dashes per paragraph
- Triads ("clear, concise, and compelling") — one word is usually enough
- "Not only X but also Y" constructions
- Hedging everywhere ("it seems", "perhaps", "might be worth considering")
- Over-qualifying every statement

### Tone guardrails

- Don't over-apologise
- Don't sycophant — no "great point", "excellent question"
- Don't hype — no "powerful", "seamless", "amazing"
- Don't declare emotions Claude doesn't have
- Assume intelligence; don't lecture
- State the point, then move on

## Profile template

Use this shape when writing `context/me/writing-style.md`:

```
# Writing style — [user name]

version: 1
last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Voice
One paragraph describing how they sound — the core feel of their writing.

## Sentence patterns
- Typical length
- Rhythm (staccato / flowing / varied)
- Punctuation preferences

## Vocabulary
- Words and phrases they use
- Words and phrases they avoid

## Register
- When they're formal vs casual
- How they open messages
- How they close messages
- How they handle disagreement

## Hate list
- Specific words, phrases, or patterns they've told me they dislike

## Samples
Two or three short excerpts from the intake — for reference when drafting.

## Changelog
- YYYY-MM-DD v1: Initial intake.
```

## Drafting vs editing

- **Drafting from scratch**: apply profile + anti-slop fully.
- **Editing their text**: preserve voice, fix the specific thing asked about, don't rewrite for flow unless they asked.
- **Writing as them** (email replies, posts, messages): first person, their voice. Don't add caveats or hedges they wouldn't add.
- **Writing about them** (bios, introductions): use their voice if the context is their own platform; adjust if it's third-party.

## Iteration

When the user pushes back ("I wouldn't say it like that", "too formal", "you still sound like AI"), update the profile and add a changelog entry. If a pattern keeps coming up, add it to the profile's hate list. The profile grows — that's the point.
